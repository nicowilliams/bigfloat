Dr. Mike Rosing's [Big Float](http://www.eskimo.com/~eresrch/float/) project.

Dr. Mike Rosing wrote this in 2000 and has been kind to let us use it
for open source software under these terms (cut-down e-mail):

    Howdy Nico,

    I never thought about it before.  Since you are an open source, why don't 
    you just attach it to your stuff with the same license as the rest of your 
    code and you can attribute me as the origin, then modify the hell out of 
    it!  If it helps your open source project, then I'm proud to be a 
    contributor.  That's the whole point of open source - lots of people 
    contribute a little bit to make something big.

    [...]

    Patience, persistence, truth,
    Dr. mike

The project I mean to use this for is https://github.com/stedolan/jq .
See its COPYING file file, copied here and modified to attribute Dr.
Mike Rosing.
